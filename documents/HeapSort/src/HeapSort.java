/**
 * The main method that runs the program 
 * Implements a heap sort for binary data 
 * Takes in record blocks divisible by 8 and 
 * sorts sections using replacement selection 
 * into a working memory that is 8 blocks long 
 * Runs are output to the output buffer 
 * Whenever output buffer is full, it is written into
 * an output file called run file 
 * 
 * Takes a record file and statistics file 
 * Sorts the record file on disk
